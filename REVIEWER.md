# Code Reviewer Manual

## Objective

The purpose of this manual is to provide guidelines for performing code reviews effectively,
ensuring code quality and promoting best practices among developers.

## Review Structure

### 1. **Planning**

- **Allocate adequate time**: Set aside enough time to review the code thoroughly.
- **Focus**: Concentrate on the code under review, avoiding multitasking.
- **Understand the context**: Read the pull request description, task tickets, or related
  documentation to grasp the purpose of the code.

---

### 2. **Review Checklist**

1. **Code Quality**
    - Is the code clear and easy to understand?
    - Does it follow the teamâ€™s coding standards?
    - Are variable, method, and class names meaningful?
    - Is it well-organized and free from duplication?

2. **Functionality**
    - Does the code meet the requirements outlined in the task or ticket?
    - Are the expected scenarios handled appropriately?
    - Are there tests covering the main and edge cases?

3. **Best Practices**
    - Does the code utilize good programming practices (e.g., SOLID, DRY, KISS)?
    - Is error handling appropriate?
    - Are there no unnecessary hardcoded values?

4. **Performance**
    - Is the code efficient for the current use case?
    - Are there potential performance bottlenecks?

5. **Security**
    - Is the code protected against known vulnerabilities?
    - Are sensitive data handled properly (e.g., encryption, validations)?

6. **Testing**
    - Does the code include automated tests (unit, integration)?
    - Are the tests meaningful and cover critical scenarios?

7. **Documentation**
    - Are there clear comments for complex parts of the code?
    - Is the documentation, if necessary, updated?

### 3. **Feedback**

- **Be clear**: Use examples and reference specific code snippets.
- **Be polite**: Provide constructive criticism and avoid a harsh tone.
- **Be objective**: Focus on what truly matters and avoid pointing out trivial issues.

#### Feedback Example

```plaintext
[Good example]
The `calculateTotal` function is well-written but could be clearer. Consider using a more descriptive name for the variable `x`, such as `totalAmount`.

[Bad example]
The code is confusing, rename the variables.
